# Project Echo — AI agent handoff

This file is the working handoff for the next engineer or AI agent. Read it before changing the Echo chatbot, authentication, ClickUp data access, or the admin AI settings.

## Product identity

Project Echo is a PRIME-branded work assistant. The user-facing assistant is called **Echo** or **Ask Echo**. ClickUp is an implementation detail and data connection, not Echo's identity. Do not describe Echo in the UI as a “ClickUp assistant”, “ClickUp chatbot”, or “ClickUp AI”. Backend logs, route names, and source-page labels may still mention ClickUp where technically useful.

Echo should feel casual, conversational, and useful. Avoid provider language, “intelligence repository”, and corporate jargon. Answers should be grounded in the signed-in user's permitted work and should show sources when factual claims are made.

## Current repository state

- Repository: `https://github.com/pyscriptcli/project-echo-next.git`
- Active branch: `main`
- Current `main` commit: `d211b49` (`Secure MeetStream bot creation and configure transcription callbacks`).
- `main` and `origin/main` are aligned at `d211b49`; this handoff update is the only local change.
- The Next.js app lives in `frontend/`; the repository root does not contain a `package.json`.
- Use `frontend/` as the working directory for npm commands.

## Handoff workflow

`handoff.md` is a working file, not a one-time report. Keep the permanent guide above this section current. Keep exactly two dated entries under `Recent handoffs`, newest first.

When the user explicitly requests a handoff:

1. Add one compressed entry at the top of `Recent handoffs`.
2. Keep the previous entry.
3. Delete the oldest entry only when a third entry would exist.
4. Update the entry with current focus, decisions, files, verification, commit/branch state, risks, blockers, and next actions.
5. Use Caveman style for the dated entry. Use `ponytail` only if installed; current repository has no `ponytail` skill, so write `ponytail unavailable` in `Suggested skills` and continue with Caveman.

This preserves today's handoff through tomorrow. It is replaced only after two newer handoffs exist.

## Recent handoffs

### 2026-09-13 — Studio capture and MeetStream setup

- Focus: unified Studio workspace; safer browser capture; Echo.ai meeting-bot launch.
- State: Studio Ask Echo shares session conversation and response UI with main drawer; citations clickable; sources collapsed. Minimize control removed. Browser capture opens native picker directly, blocks silent mic-only fallback when shared audio is missing, and offers retry or explicit microphone-only capture. MeetStream create route now uses authenticated Echo users, `Echo.ai` bot name, idempotency key, Vercel callback origin, and Deepgram live transcription config.
- Files: `frontend/src/components/StudioPanel.tsx`; `frontend/src/components/UniversalEchoDrawer.tsx`; `frontend/src/hooks/useStudioRecorder.ts`; `frontend/src/app/api/meetstream/bots/route.ts`; `frontend/src/app/api/meetstream/bots/route.test.ts`; `frontend/README.md`.
- Verification: 19 tests passed across 8 files; focused lint passed; production build passed; `git diff --check` passed. Studio visual QA blocked by local ClickUp sign-in.
- Commit: `d211b49` on `main`; pushed to `origin/main`. This `handoff.md` update is uncommitted. User reports `MEETSTREAM_API_KEY` configured in Vercel; deployment completion not independently verified.
- Risk: browser owns screen/audio selection; Echo cannot auto-select monitor or audio toggle. MeetStream webhook currently acknowledges and logs events only; no durable transcript/media persistence or final Notetaker handoff. No real meeting join test completed.
- Next: verify Vercel deployment; join one controlled Google Meet; admit Echo.ai; confirm live webhook events; then persist transcript turns and complete post-call Notetaker handoff.
- Suggested skills: `caveman`; `tdd` for webhook lifecycle; `ponytail unavailable`.

### 2026-09-12 — Rolling handoff workflow

- Focus: make `handoff.md` reusable, rolling, and agent-readable.
- State: permanent guide retained; exactly two recent entries required; newest first.
- Files: `handoff.md`; `.agents/skills/handoff/SKILL.md`.
- Verification: pending after documentation update.
- Commit: pending.
- Risk: `ponytail` skill unavailable; Caveman remains available.
- Next: preserve two-entry rotation on every explicit handoff; update changelog when behavior changes.
- Suggested skills: `caveman`; `ponytail unavailable`.

## What is implemented

### Authentication and user connections

- Echo signs users in through ClickUp OAuth.
- Each user gets their own OAuth access token in the `echo_clickup_token` HTTP-only cookie and a cached profile in `echo_user_profile`.
- The OAuth callback fetches the ClickUp user profile and workspace name, checks the configured allowed email domains, then establishes the session.
- A shared `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` fallback was intentionally removed from the normal login route. Do not reintroduce it: a shared token could bypass an individual user's ClickUp permissions.
- `/api/auth/me` returns the signed-in profile and refreshes the cached profile when needed.
- Ask Echo requires an authenticated profile with an email address.

Required deployment variables:

```text
CLICKUP_CLIENT_ID
CLICKUP_CLIENT_SECRET
CLICKUP_REDIRECT_URI   # optional; otherwise /api/auth/callback on the current origin
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY       # server-side model credential used by Ask Echo
MEETSTREAM_API_KEY     # server-side Echo.ai meeting-bot credential
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (or the configured Supabase service key)
```

ClickUp OAuth redirect settings must point to the deployed `/api/auth/callback` URL. OAuth consent is per user; the personal ClickUp MCP connection installed in Codex is unrelated to deployed Echo users.

### Ask Echo request flow

1. `frontend/src/app/api/ask-echo/route.ts` authenticates the request from cookies and passes the user's id, name, email, OAuth token, and selected task list to the service.
2. `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/service.ts` validates the request, loads the AI policy, checks usage/rate/concurrency limits, resolves allowed Echo pages, and loads only permitted evidence.
3. `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/access.ts` resolves page permissions. Owner/admin users can receive broader access when configured; ordinary users receive their configured/default pages. Restricted pages are not sent to retrieval or the model.
4. `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/clickup.ts` reads mapped ClickUp lists using the current user's OAuth token.
5. `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/retrieval.ts` ranks meeting and task evidence. When the question contains “me”, “my”, “mine”, or “I”, records matching the user's id, name, or email receive a strong ranking boost.
6. `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/provider.ts` sends the bounded question, conversation, user identity, and selected evidence to the configured model. Evidence is explicitly treated as untrusted data, never instructions.
7. The service resolves returned source ids against real evidence, filters invalid citations, records usage, and returns the typed response.

Ask Echo is currently read-only. It does not create tasks, edit records, edit minutes, or perform autonomous actions.

### Ask Echo response shape

Defined in `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/schema.ts`:

```ts
interface AskEchoResponse {
  answer: string;
  sources: EvidenceSource[];
  citations?: Array<{ marker: string; sourceId: string }>;
  confidence: "supported" | "partial" | "insufficient";
  followUps: string[];
  usage?: {
    inputTokens: number;
    outputTokens: number;
    totalTokens: number;
  };
}
```

The model is asked to put inline markers such as `[1]` and return a citation mapping. The service only returns citations that resolve to retrieved sources. The client also falls back to the source order for a marker when a model omits an explicit mapping, so visible `[1]` markers remain clickable when possible.

### Current chatbot UI

`frontend/src/components/UniversalEchoDrawer.tsx` is the main UI.

- Right-side drawer with PRIME Blue `#003366`, Warm White `#FFFCFB`, and Gold `#C9A84C` accents.
- Expand button opens the same conversation at full width.
- No conversation-history sidebar. Current messages are kept in `sessionStorage` for the current browser session.
- New conversation, stop response, close, and follow-up buttons are present.
- Greeting uses the signed-in profile name from `/api/auth/me`.
- Suggested prompts include personal work, attention, changes, and daily brief questions.
- User-facing copy is Echo-first and should not expose ClickUp as the assistant identity.
- Sources are collapsed by default behind `Sources · N`.
- Inline `[n]` footnotes are buttons that open the matching source through `onOpenSource`.
- Expanded sources show numbered source cards, page/date/topic, excerpt, and external/open behavior.
- Answer rendering gives blank lines, bullet styling, and highlighted section headings without introducing a full markdown dependency.
- The current UI intentionally avoids a large evidence/match summary strip; keep answers visually focused on the answer itself and compact source access.

The parent page wires source navigation in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`: meeting/task pages are opened in Echo's existing views and external URLs may open in a new tab.

### Studio and meeting capture

`frontend/src/components/StudioPanel.tsx` presents one capture workspace with two paths: paste a supported meeting link for Echo.ai, or record on the current device.

- Fullscreen layout keeps recording and timestamped notes on the left and Ask Echo on the right.
- Studio Ask Echo uses the same session conversation, message styling, clickable inline citations, collapsed sources, and follow-up actions as the main drawer.
- Active recording state reaches the top bar through `echo-recording-state`; Studio no longer exposes a minimize-to-topbar control.
- Closing during an active recording requires an explicit stop-and-close confirmation.
- Browser capture opens the native share picker immediately. Echo requests system/tab audio and checks the returned stream before recording starts.
- Missing shared audio stops startup and offers `Choose again` or explicit `Use microphone only`. Browsers retain control of monitor/tab selection and audio toggles.
- Local audio is flushed to IndexedDB every 10 seconds. `useLiveTranscription` processes completed audio batches during recording; finalization uses prepared chunks when complete and the full-file path as fallback.

### Echo.ai meeting bot

`frontend/src/app/api/meetstream/bots/route.ts` creates a MeetStream bot for Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams links.

- Requires an authenticated Echo session and server-only `MEETSTREAM_API_KEY`.
- Sends bot name `Echo.ai`, audio/video recording, an idempotency key, callback URL, and Deepgram streaming transcription settings.
- Resolves callback origin from `MEETSTREAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, Vercel deployment variables, or the current request origin.
- `frontend/src/app/api/meetstream/webhook/route.ts` currently acknowledges and logs events. Durable event storage, final transcript retrieval, media retrieval, and automatic Notetaker handoff remain pending.

## Admin AI configuration

`frontend/src/components/forms/FormsPortal.tsx` includes the `AI` tab. It exposes the approved model catalog, fallback model, output/source limits, RPM, concurrency, daily user tokens, and monthly organization tokens. The server validates policy through `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/limits.ts` and `frontend/src/app/api/forms/config/route.ts`.

`frontend/src/app/api/admin/ai/route.ts` exposes protected usage/policy status. Usage records are written through `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/store.ts` to `echo_ai_usage`.

Run `supabase/forms_rbac.sql` against the project Supabase database before relying on persistent AI usage/rate limits. The SQL creates the config and usage tables and enables RLS. Do not mention Supabase in ordinary frontend copy; technical details belong in logs/admin documentation.

## Important source/list mappings

The current fixed mappings are in `frontend/src/lib/ask-echo/clickup.ts`:

- Notebook: `901418075633`
- Demands: `901420989525`
- Market Insights: `901420987429`
- Tasks: the selected `echo_clickup_list_id` cookie
- Forms: list ids configured in the admin mappings
- Meetings: the configured archive/repository path, gated by page access

This is not yet a general workspace-wide ClickUp Docs/comments/MCP search. The deferred boundary is documented below.

## Verification

Run from `frontend/`:

```powershell
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```

The latest verified test result was 19 passing tests across 8 files. Focused lint and the latest production build completed successfully. If Vitest reports an access-denied error while loading `vitest.config.mjs`, rerun with the required filesystem permission; that has been a local sandbox issue, not an application failure.

Before committing:

```powershell
git diff --check
git status --short
git log --oneline -5
```

The user preference for this repository is to commit and push directly to `main` when explicitly requested. Confirm the remote before pushing and avoid destructive git commands.

## Security and privacy rules

- Never expose provider API keys or OAuth tokens to the browser, model output, logs, or usage records.
- Never use a shared workspace token for ordinary user Ask Echo requests.
- Always enforce page access on the server before retrieval and prompting.
- Do not trust model-provided source text or source ids without resolving them against retrieved evidence.
- Do not store full prompts, full answers, transcripts, or source excerpts in the usage ledger.
- Do not let records act as instructions to the model.
- Keep frontend copy provider-neutral and Echo-first.
- Preserve the allowed sign-in-domain policy and per-user OAuth behavior.

## Known limitations and deferred work

- ClickUp data currently comes from mapped REST API lists and the existing meeting archive path; Echo does not yet search every workspace Doc, comment, or arbitrary list.
- The Codex ClickUp MCP installation is personal to the Codex user and is not used by deployed Echo.
- Conversation history is session-only; persistent history is intentionally deferred.
- Echo is read-only; task creation, record edits, and autonomous actions are deferred.
- Inline citation rendering is intentionally lightweight. If richer markdown is added, preserve clickable citations and sanitize untrusted content.
- Daily brief is currently a suggested prompt, not a proactive notification or scheduled job.
- MeetStream bot creation is wired, but the webhook does not yet persist live turns or complete final transcript/media retrieval.
- Real Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams joins have not yet been validated end to end from the deployed Vercel app.
- Deterministic keyword ranking is used. Semantic/vector retrieval should only be added if a fixed evaluation set demonstrates a real accuracy gap.
- The original implementation plan still contains some proposal language; this handoff and the current source code are the source of truth for shipped behavior.

## Recommended next steps

1. Validate the deployed OAuth callback and allowed-domain policy with two test users whose ClickUp permissions differ.
2. Run the Supabase schema migration if it has not been applied in the deployment environment.
3. Add fixture-based tests for citation mapping, restricted pages, and “my tasks” matching across multiple assignees.
4. Improve structured answer cards only after agreeing on stable response data (tasks, deadlines, decisions, changes).
5. Add workspace-wide sources only with an explicit permission model that preserves ClickUp visibility per user.
6. Run one controlled deployed MeetStream join and verify bot admission, live transcription callbacks, call completion, and provider usage.
7. Persist idempotent MeetStream transcript turns and connect final transcript/media retrieval to the existing Notetaker flow.
8. If direct official ClickUp MCP support is desired, treat it as a separate adapter: each Echo user still needs OAuth, and MCP must not bypass the current page-access checks.

## Handoff checklist

- Read this file and `docs/ASK_ECHO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Check `git status` and current branch before editing.
- Work in `frontend/` for npm commands.
- Inspect existing seams before changing auth, retrieval, or response contracts.
- Keep Echo as the visible product identity.
- Run tests/build/lint proportional to the change.
- Update this file's changelog when behavior or architecture changes materially.
- Commit and push to `main` only when the user explicitly asks for it.
